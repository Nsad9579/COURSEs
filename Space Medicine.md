### Week 1 - History of Medicine and Aviation

space is a rough place! and every adaptation your body has gathered to help you live assumes that you'll actully be on Earth!!!

without a space suit;

- there is no cold air >>> you feel warm 
- lack of atmospheric pressure >>> you will experience a rapid decompression so 

        1. air inside the lungs expands
        2. liquids like blood begin to boil 
        3. air bubbles would form in the arteries and veins causing trauma to some tissue 
        4. the lack of pressure would even pull oxygen out of the blood through the lungs

- 15 seconds amount of time until you fall uncontious without a suit and barelly alive after 1 minute 
- radiation >>> Causing Cancer and reduce your Immune system eficiency
- microgravity >>> your muscle mass reduces and you expereince Muscular Atrophy and also Bone density reduces

        50% of muscle mass could be lost on longer space missions
        
One of the sentences that really touched my heart was this;

        " Space is not an easily habitable envirement but even here kife finds a way"
        
### Week 3 - Case Study: Caisson Worker's Disease

- BaroTrauma : destruction caused by changes of pressure

- Trauma: a wide range of issues in medicine that covers everything from burns to broken bones and scrapes to stabs
